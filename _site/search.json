The idea behind this blog is to have a place that I can use as a digital notebook with notes on how to code my most used models and new ones I learn as I go. I like the idea of having a centralized website with an organized repository to all my scripts instead of having them scattered across multiple laptops and external hard drives. However, I think that others may find my code and explanations (i.e., blog posts) useful and I hope this blog can help others learn as well. I plan to cover from the most basic models to the more complex ones I learn.\nYou can follow me on , where I am very active -for the most part."
