    "section": "",
    "text": "If you are a researcher, one of my biggest pieces of advice is to make a website. It doesn’t matter if you are just starting grad school or have already graduated. The main idea behind having a website is to control how other researchers —or the media, potential employers, etc.— may find you. And then, of course, so that you can have all your papers readily available, as well as your CV/resume, etc. However, if you DO NOT have a website or have been postponing it because why do it today if you can do it tomorrow, then at least make sure other researchers can easily find ways to contact you.\nLast week, I emailed a group of researchers about a possible collaboration with me. I could find everyone’s email within seconds EXCEPT for one. I kept looking, but after 7 minutes I gave up, which meant that I wouldn’t be able to contact him/her and they would lose the opportunity to be in this collaboration -or at least to know about it even if they decline to be involved. So I started thinking about ways to make your email public without necessarily having a website.\nHere, I give you some ideas on how to make your email easy to find without having to create a website.\n\n\nIf you don’t have an (ORCID ID)[orcid.org] then I suggest you start one today. Basically, it’s like having a website for academics who publish but without photos. Every time you publish a paper, it will appear listed on your orcid website. In their website, orcid states that ‘You can connect your iD with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more.’. Another great thing is that you can have all the ways in which your name may appear on a publication. For example, if your name is Andrew but sometimes people call you Andy or Drew then you can list them all here so that your publications can be linked here no matter the way your name was spelled.\nGreat!

    "text": "If you are a researcher, one of my biggest pieces of advice is to make a website. It doesn’t matter if you are just starting grad school or have already graduated. The main idea behind having a website is to control how other researchers —or the media, potential employers, etc.— may find you. And then, of course, so that you can have all your papers readily available, as well as your CV/resume, etc. However, if you DO NOT have a website or have been postponing it because why do it today if you can do it tomorrow, then at least make sure other researchers can easily find ways to contact you.\nLast week, I emailed a group of researchers about a possible collaboration with me. I could find everyone’s email within seconds EXCEPT for one. I kept looking, but after 7 minutes I gave up, which meant that I wouldn’t be able to contact him/her and they would lose the opportunity to be in this collaboration -or at least to know about it even if they decline to be involved. So I started thinking about ways to make your email public without necessarily having a website.\nHere, I give you some ideas on how to make your email easy to find without having to create a website.\n\n\nIf you don’t have an (ORCID ID)[orcid.org] then I suggest you start one today. Basically, it’s like having a website for academics who publish but without photos. Every time you publish a paper, it will appear listed on your orcid website. In their website, orcid states that ‘You can connect your iD with your professional information — affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more.’. Another great thing is that you can have all the ways in which your name may appear on a publication. For example, if your name is Andrew but sometimes people call you Andy or Drew then you can list them all here so that your publications can be linked here no matter the way your name was spelled.\nGreat! How do you make your email be visible here?\n\nOn orcid’s website, you can control if you want all or just some of your emails public (green circle), only visible to orcid users who have logged in (yellow circle with a key), or private, which is visible only to you (red circle with lock).

The diameter is labled as girth in the dataset so let’s start by renaming it to diameter.\n\ntrees &lt;- trees %&gt;% \n  rename(Diameter = Girth) # new name = old name\n\n# Let's check that it worked \nnames(trees)\n\n[1] \"Diameter\" \"Height\"   \"Volume\"  \n\n\nNow let’s fit a linear regression between Diameter and Volume. This is just a silly example just to have a graph on which we can plot a silhouette.\n\nggplot(trees,aes(Diameter, Volume)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x) +\n  theme_classic()+\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = 'bold', size = 16),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) -&gt; ourplot\nourplot \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s put a silhouette on that plot!\nLet’s start by checking if we have silhouettes for the species we want. In this case a black cherry tree which is Prunus serotina\n\nbct &lt;- pick_phylopic(name = 'Prunus serotina')\n\nError in get_uuid(name = name, n = n, url = FALSE) : Image resource not available for name. Ensure provided name is a valid taxonomic name or try a species/genus resolution name.\nWe got an error saying there are no available silhouettes for this species (note to self, we should draw this and upload it asap!). So let’s check another one that looks like our black cherry trees. How about Flowering Dogwood, Cornus florida. It’s not the same species obviously but the silhouette could represent either tree. Not ideal but for this example I suppose it’s ok.\n\nbct &lt;- pick_phylopic(name='Cornus florida')\n\nWarning in get_uuid(name = name, n = n, filter = filter, url = FALSE): Only 1\nitem(s) are available.\n\n\nThis is the only image.

Sometimes, you get a species with more than one silhouette but you can see them all by typing 1 on the console when prompted. See my tweet here for an example on how to do this.\nNow back to our plot. Let’s add a silhouette. To know where to place it, think of the arguments x and y as coordinates on your graph, and the silhouette as a point you want to place in the plot. So here, I wanted it on the lower left part of the plot, which corresponds with x=20 and y = 10. The center of the silhouette will be placed on that point. The ysize argument controls how tall the silhouette will be, and is in relation to the y-axis scale.\n\nourplot +\n  add_phylopic(img = bct, # silhouette \n               x=20, # based on x axis coordinates\n               y=10, # based on y axis coordinates \n               ysize = 20) -&gt; ourplot \nourplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s put the silhouette next to a legend\nNow because we want the silhouette outside the plot, we must set the coordinates to negative. In this case, the legend is at the bottom so we set the y-axis coordinates to -20.\n\nggplot(trees,aes(Diameter, Volume)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x, aes(color = 'lm')) +\n  scale_color_manual(name = 'Legend', values = 'blue')+\n  theme_classic()+\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = 'bold', size = 16),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 14),\n        legend.position = 'bottom',\n      # The backgroun of the legend set to transparent because it \n      # overlaps the silhouette\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\"))+\n  add_phylopic(img = bct, # silhouette \n               x=13, # based on x axis coordinates\n      # The y must be set to negative so it's outside the plot\n               y=-19, # based on y axis coordinates \n               ysize = 8) -&gt; ourplot_legend \nourplot_legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than one silhouette on the plot\nIf you want to add more than one silhouette, then just use the ‘add_phylopic()’ function again. I re-used the same silhouette, but you could use another one here.\n\nourplot +\n  add_phylopic(img = bct, # First silhouette \n               x=20, # based on x axis coordinates\n               y=10, # based on y axis coordinates \n               ysize = 20)+ # based on y axis coordinates \n  add_phylopic(img=bct, # Second silhouette \n               x=10, \n               y=70, \n               ysize = 30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints as silhouettes\nIf you wanted the points to be little trees instead of points, then you can do so like this.

For example, the notebook here is my Spatial Analysis in R notebook where I keep all my notes regarding this topic, for example, from reading a book chapter or watching a YouTube video, etc. That included code. This is not efficient for two reasons, first because I am constantly moving and need to keep as few things as I can, and second because code is not analogue! So I decided to create a blog to keep all my scripts perfectly organized so I can reference them in the future and have my code ready for whenever I need it instead of rummaging through my folders in external hard drives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Spatial Ecology Notebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy GEE Notebbok\n\n\n\n\n\nI also think that some of these scripts may be useful to others to learn or improve their code. I would also love to write posts with others so I can have the opportunity to learn from others too. I think this could be a good space to have that.\nThanks for reading!\nG"

    "text": "Organize the project and directory\nPerhaps you are used to starting by setting your directory using setwd(). However, I highly recommend you use RStudio Projects. RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.\nWe are going to start by creating a Project in RStudio. A Project is essentially a directory which will contain all the files you need for a specific project. It will have a *.RProj file associated with it to begin with.\nGo to RStudio and click on File &gt; New Project.\n\nNow you see three options:\n\nNew directory: choose this option if you want to create a folder that will contain all the subdirectories and files of this particular project.\nExisting directory: use this option if you already created a folder which will contain all the subdirectories and files for this particular project. Choose that folder here.\nVersion Control: choose this option if you are going to work with a repository already stored in GitHub.\n\nFor our own project, let’s go ahead and choose ‘New Directory’ and let’s name our project: ‘2024-data-manipulation-UWIN’\n\nOther files inside the main directory\nYou will have a series of directories inside your project, depending on the type of work that you’ll be working on. Some people recommend following the same structure that you would use if creating an r package. However, I think that at a minimum, you could have the following structure:\n\n\nData is a directory that has all your original .csv files with the data that you will use in your analysis.\nFunctions is a directory that houses all the functions you create and that you will be using throughout your analysis. Some people include this directory as a subdirectory of R.\nPlots is a directory in which you will put all the graphs you create as part of your analysis.\nR is a directory that will have all the scripts needed for your analysis.\nResults is a directory that you may or may not need. The idea is to include all the resulting .csv or .rds files in here and keep them separate from your original files.\nYou may need other directories, especially if you are working with spatial data, for example, shapefiles, rasters, maps, etc."

Don’t rely on case sensitivity to distinguish files.\n2. File names should be human readable: use file names to describe what’s in the file.\n3. File names should play well with default ordering: start file names with numbers so that alphabetical sorting puts them in the order they get used.\nHere are a few examples of bad names:\n\nDocument 1.docx\nmanuscript_final.docx\nfinal_document_final.qmd\ndata.csv\n\nHere are a few examples of good names:\n\n2024_05_03_manuscript_name.R\n01_data_cleaning.R\n02_model.R\nfig-01.png\nexercise-uwin-workshop.qmd\n\nWhy are these good names?

We will need this information later but not for the main data set, so we are going to create two data frames, one with the information on the top rows and one with the info starting on row 4:\n\n\n\n\n\nocc.data &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = './data/OccupancyReport.csv', \n                               # Skip row 1-3\n                               skip = 3,\n                               # identify how not available data are coded, you can use c('NA', 'N/A')\n                               na = 'NA', \n                               # define column types, readr guesses the ones we don't specify\n                               col_types = c('f', 'd', 'c', 'd', 'd'))\n\n# With glimpse we can see the name of each column, type, and the first rows \ndplyr::glimpse(occ.data)\n\nRows: 50\nColumns: 41\n$ Species   &lt;fct&gt; Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyo…\n$ Season    &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ Site      &lt;chr&gt; \"NCAP-MD-BSP1\", \"NCAP-MD-CCC1\", \"NCAP-MD-CRG1\", \"NCAP-MD-CVH…\n$ Latitude  &lt;dbl&gt; 38.8452, 38.9939, 38.8145, 39.0284, 38.7699, 38.9553, 38.814…\n$ Longitude &lt;dbl&gt; -76.9015, -77.0838, -76.9872, -77.0586, -77.0286, -76.8917, …\n$ Day_1     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA,…\n$ Day_2     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA,…\n$ Day_3     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA,…\n$ Day_4     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,…\n$ Day_5     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NA, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, NA…\n$ Day_6     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_7     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_8     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_9     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_10    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_11    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_12    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_13    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_14    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_15    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_16    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_17    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_18    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_19    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_20    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_21    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_22    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_23    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_24    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_25    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_26    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_27    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_28    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_29    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_30    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_31    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_32    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, NA…\n$ Day_33    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n$ Day_34    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n$ Day_35    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n$ Day_36    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n\n\nNow let’s extract the Start and End dates, we may need them later on.\n\nocc.info &lt;- read_csv(file = './data/OccupancyReport.csv', \n                        n_max = 1) |&gt; \n  select('Start Date', 'End Date')\n  \nglimpse(occ.info)\n\nRows: 1\nColumns: 2\n$ `Start Date` &lt;chr&gt; \"1/10/2022\"\n$ `End Date`   &lt;chr&gt; \"2/14/2022\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the column names.

Let’s review the current name conventions:\n\nThis is important to remember so that you (and your team) can always stick to a name convention to make things easier for everyone. Whichever you use, DO NOT USE A SPACE TO SEPARATE WORDS.\n\nThese are ok for the name of a column: ‘day01’, ‘Day_1’, ‘day1’, ‘day-01’, ‘day-1’\nThis is not ok: ‘day 1’\n\n\n\n\nYou can leave the column names as is, but I want to show you a super handy function in package janitor that can help us rename all the columns to fit one naming convention. The options for case are ‘snake’, ‘lower_camel’, ‘title’, ‘upper_camel’.\n\nocc.data &lt;- janitor::clean_names(dat = occ.data, \n                                 case = 'snake')\nglimpse(occ.data)\n\nRows: 50\nColumns: 41\n$ species   &lt;fct&gt; Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyote, Coyo…\n$ season    &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ site      &lt;chr&gt; \"NCAP-MD-BSP1\", \"NCAP-MD-CCC1\", \"NCAP-MD-CRG1\", \"NCAP-MD-CVH…\n$ latitude  &lt;dbl&gt; 38.8452, 38.9939, 38.8145, 39.0284, 38.7699, 38.9553, 38.814…\n$ longitude &lt;dbl&gt; -76.9015, -77.0838, -76.9872, -77.0586, -77.0286, -76.8917, …\n$ day_1     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA,…\n$ day_2     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA,…\n$ day_3     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA,…\n$ day_4     &lt;dbl&gt; NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,…\n$ day_5     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NA, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, NA…\n$ day_6     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_7     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_8     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_9     &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_10    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_11    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_12    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_13    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_14    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_15    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_16    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_17    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_18    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_19    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_20    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_21    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_22    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_23    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_24    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_25    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_26    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_27    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_28    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_29    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_30    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_31    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_32    &lt;dbl&gt; 0, NA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, 0, NA…\n$ day_33    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n$ day_34    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n$ day_35    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n$ day_36    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, 0, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 0,…\n\n\nHave you noticed that we have two species in our data?\n\nunique(occ.data$species)\n\n[1] Coyote                    Eastern cottontail rabbit\nLevels: Coyote Eastern cottontail rabbit"
