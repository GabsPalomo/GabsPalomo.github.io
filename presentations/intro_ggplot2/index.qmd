## Examples 

I try to keep the lecture to 45 min so I can live code the following examples with the students so they can code at the same time with me.

## Homework 

I give them these exercises at the end so they can work on them throughout the week. I took the data from the Valliere (2022) paper and cleaned it up a little so the data was easier for intro level students to work with.

  - [dataset 1](/slides/intro_ggplot2/camera_data.csv) and [dataset 2](/slides/intro_ggplot2/scat_data.csv)
